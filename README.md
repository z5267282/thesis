# Overview

This tool intelligently traces a Python program by only showing selected lines of execution.
We only show conditionals that evaluate to True.
Within loops, we show the first path and any unique ones thereafter.

# Restrictions

Programs are restricted to the following syntax features:

1. Variable assignments
2. Printing
3. Conditionals
4. While loops

# Usage
